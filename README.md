Test task, working with text in Delphi:

Specify your own component names.

When resizing the form, the components in the panel below must remain in place relative to the top left corner of the panel. The panel should fill the entire bottom of the form, the input field the entire top.

Any text should be entered into the upper part of the form. When pressing the "select" button, depending on the selection in the drop-down list, output the first, second or third line in the field above the button.
If nothing is selected in the list, display the message "Parameter not selected".

If there is too little text (if you select "second", there is no second line), output an empty line.

When you press the "Number of letters b" button, the program should count how many "b" and "B" there are in the text and output the result as an integer in the same field to output the string.
